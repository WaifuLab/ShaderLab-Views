/**
 * Key bindings associate key names with [command]{@link Command}-style functions.
 *
 * Key names may be strings like `"Shift-Ctrl-Enter"`â€”a key identifier prefixed with zero or more
 * modifiers. Key identifiers are based on the strings that can appear in
 * [`KeyEvent.key`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key)
 * Use lowercase letters to refer to letter keys (or uppercase letters if you want shift to be held).
 * You may use `"Space"` as an alias for the `" "` name.
 *
 * When a key binding contains multiple key names separated by spaces, it represents a multi-stroke
 * binding, which will fire when the user presses the given keys after each other.
 *
 * You can use `Mod-` as a shorthand for `Cmd-` on Mac and `Ctrl-` on other platforms. So `Mod-b`
 * is `Ctrl-b` on Linux but `Cmd-b` on macOS.
